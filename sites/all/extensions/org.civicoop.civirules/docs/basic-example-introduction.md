We will start with some basic examples to feel at ease with the user interface.
The [first chapter](basic-example-immediate-processing) shows how to configure a trigger that is immediately executed. The [second chapter](basic-example-immediate-processing) shows a trigger that is executed with a scheduled job. The [third chapter](basic-example-introduction) deals with a complete example of donor segmentation. [The fourth chapter](basic-example-introduction) explains how you can use the powerful _Condition Field Value Comparison_ to do almost any condition you can imagine.

!!! Note
    The concept 'trigger' was first coined as 'event'. This caused a lot of confusion with CiviEvents, so it was renamed to 'trigger'. However, sometimes you can find traces of the former name in the screendumps.
