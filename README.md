CiviCRM Starterkit for Pantheon
===============================

The [CiviCRM Starterkit](http://civicrmstarterkit.org/) project is not intended to be installed on its own. Instead, you can quickly get started with CiviCRM by [spinning it up on Pantheon](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/products/civicrm_starterkit/spinup).

Updates
-------

This Pantheon upstream attempts to keep up to date with Pantheon's core Drupal 7 repository, with basic Drupal module security updates, and with updates to CiviCRM core long-term support version.

Versions
--------

The Starterkit is currently using CiviCRM 4.6.x since it is the long-term support (LTS) version. Once LTS moves to 4.7 we will update the Starterkit to use it. Users will see the update in the Pantheon dashboard.

Alternative
-----------

If you would prefer not to use this Starterkit--whether you already have a Drupal 7 website on Pantheon, you prefer to get the upstream updates directly from Pantheon--then you can also use the [minimially patched version of CiviCRM](https://github.com/freeform/civicrm-drupal-pantheon). This alternative requires a bit more work but provides CiviCRM 4.7 as an option. The [wiki](https://github.com/freeform/civicrm-drupal-pantheon/wiki) provides some steps on how to install it.
